# base64
 A simple base64 encoder/decoder program written in C, as an exercise.
 The whole program is implemented in `base64.c`.

 The repo also contains `base64_experiments.c`, with another implementation of the encoding algorithm; this alternate implementation is worse in any way than the naive/common one, but it was fun to design and write.

# Building
 Just invoke any C compiler on `base64.c`.
 If you are on Windows, you can use the provided `build.bat` - just make sure to be in a Developer Command Prompt.
